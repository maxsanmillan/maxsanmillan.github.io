I am a research economist at the Financial Studies Division at the [Central Bank of Chile](https://www.bcentral.cl/web/banco-central/areas/investigacion). My research interests lie in the intersection between **macroeconomics and banking**. My work focuses on (among other topics) financial stability and the effectiveness of macroprudential regulation.
